## Projects

### YOUTUBE X-RAY [[Demo](https://share.streamlit.io/peguin03/youtube-x-ray/SearchApp.py)]
Description: A Video Search technique which enables to search any frame within a video with a Natural Language Query semantically
representing the description of the frame. With OpenAI’s CLIP, it searches any youtube video against any text and presents with top k frames
related to the text. With Distill-Bert and Faiss Index, it searchs any specific topic within lectures in youtube and retrieves top k timestamps of
the video related to the queried topic

### Neural Voice Imitation [[Demo](#)] 
Description: An encrypted Text-to-Speech (TTS) service that develops a realistic synthesized neural voice of yours with just 10 seconds of audio recording (as training data) by imitating the vocal traits of a person and can be iterated for almost any text.

## POWER CABLE DETECTION BY UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE
Description: Extracting features that indicate the presence of power lines in Visible Light and Infrared images, using ResNet-50 as base, finetuned with Powerline Image Dataset to improve power line recognition rate significantly.


### IndiCoV - Covid19 Tracker [[Demo](https://abishekv.shinyapps.io/Indi-CoV/)]
Description: A Data Visualizations Dashboard for analysis and tracking the COVID-19 Pandemic spread using covid19india api data and a bot, Dunchie which uses Google’s Speech Recognition to give updates on Covid cases in India.

###  Whittle - Analytic Engine For Small-Scale Convenience Stores [[Demo](https://abishekv.shinyapps.io/Whittle/)]
Description: Whittle is a minimalist planning and prediction-based management software for small-scale stores to curate insights.
