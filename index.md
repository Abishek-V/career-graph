## About Me

<!---<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! I am **Abishek V**, pursuing my **Masters in Data Science** from Coimbatore Institute of Technology, Coimbatore.

First and Foremost, I love Data.
Handling even rawest of data, procuring a happy headache in pre-processing it,
Spawning inferences and insights by visualization,
Decoding patterns of deadly data makes me feel so ecstatic.
Delving data, connects me to the nuances and walks me through the realm of the domain specific data.
